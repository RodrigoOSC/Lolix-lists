**Helen OS** *research/experimental*

    HelenOS is a portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designed and implemented from scratch.
    The system boots to the kernel console. Use the USB-TTL cable and the pinout depicted on the picture to get the console going.
    For full user experience, a userspace serial driver is needed, in addition to a mechanism for passing boot arguments to HelenOS.
